            During the Summer of 2025, I interned as a Software Engineer on the
            Filament UI team, where I contributed to two impactful projects:
            SCOUT and ZeroState. I was fortunate to work alongside a supportive
            and collaborative team that encouraged growth, giving me the
            confidence to take on new challenges. Through this experience, I
            strengthened my technical and design skills while making meaningful
            contributions to real production features, allowing me to grow as a
            designer and developer.

              We identified a significant challenge faced by the Filament team:
              managing and maintaining a vast codebase of over 50 consumer
              applications. As the codebase grew, it became increasingly
              difficult to track component usage across consumers, leading to
              issues such as figuring out where and how various components,
              props, and features were being utilized.

              The process of building SCOUT began with conducting thorough user
              research to understand stakeholder needs. We then identified key
              data points and target consumers, and designed a wire-framed
              prototype to visualize the tool's core functionality and workflow.
